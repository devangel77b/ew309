\begin{questions}
\question
As a team, formulate a problem statement for your auto-turret project based on the discussion in class.  Include the functions (describes what the system \emph{does}), objectives (describes what the system \emph{is}), and constraints (\emph{pass-fail} attributes of your system).


\question
Each member of the group should research three different auto-turret design alternatives that relate to the group’s problem statement.  These alternatives can be either professional level systems, hobbyist systems, or conceptual ideas (think Kickstarter, blog posts).  For each alternative, address and discuss how each alternative performs the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sense
\item Decide
\item Act
\end{itemize}

Include a critical analysis of each alternative.  The critical analysis should include discussion on the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Strengths and weakness of each alternative approach.  
\item How is it similar or different to what we are trying to accomplish in \usnaCourseNumber
\item Ways the approach could be improved
\item Environmental or ethical concerns
\end{itemize}
\end{questions}
