Volatile declarations

Notes from: https://os.mbed.com/questions/3465/Missing-volatile-keyword/

If you modify a globally defined variable in an interrupt service routine (like the function 
Ticker calls) you should declare the variable as volatile. If you change the variable in the 
interrupt service routine (i.e. the function attached to your ticker) and then use it in main,
the main function *may* use a cached version of the variable (meaning you will be using old 
information).

Syntax Example

volatile float var = 0.0
