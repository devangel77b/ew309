\begin{questions}
\question
A good problem statement for your automated turret system would accomplish all the following {\bf except} (circle all that apply):
\begin{choices}
\choice Allow for design trade space and open-ended solutions
\choice Ensure the design looks exactly like the ones from the previous year  
\choice Include any constraints or clarifying data that scope the problem
\choice Dictate the type of control algorithm required at the start of the project
\choice Clarify both what the design will and won't do 
\choice Consider any external interactions and influences that could affect the design
\choice Be very generic such that the objectives and design goals could be anything!
\end{choices}





\question
The purpose of presenting thorough background research in an engineering report or publication is to (circle {\bf all} that apply):
\begin{choices}
\choice Demonstrate an understanding of the field
\choice Increase the length of the document 
\choice Convince the reader that you are not repeating an existing and fully documented project
\choice Justify the contribution by comparing it to existing projects
\choice Background research serves no real purpose
\end{choices}

%\end{choices}






\question
Why did we implement switches into the firing circuit prior to implementing the Mbed (circle {\bf all} that apply)?
\begin{choices}
\choice To test a simplified version of the circuit prior to implementing a microcontroller
